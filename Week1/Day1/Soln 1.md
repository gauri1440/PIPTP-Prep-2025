Question 1: Soln 
There given a function of Two arguments and their values are 
W=40, X=4;
now, 
and set y=0;
then we check the if condition here condition is true 
that 40%4 ==0 || 4%40 !=0
but here one condition is true on the logical operator 
so we change the y value 
y=0+1
y=1;
So here end if 
print y 
ans =1;
